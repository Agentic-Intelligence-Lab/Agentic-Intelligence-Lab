# Research Areas

Our team at the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, specializes in **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Continuous Control.**  

We are particularly interested in advancing the following research areas:  

- Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;  
- Developing a unified theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization;  
- Scaling Laws in sequential decision-making, with a special emphasis on efficient (Multi-agent) Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms and advanced Reasoning Models;  
- Robotic Foundation Models;  
- End-to-end multi-modal learning for Humanoid Robotic Control and its industrial applications;  
- Post-training techniques for Large Language Model agents and their applications in sequential decision-making;
- Artificial General Intelligence grounded in the principles of [The Alberta Plan](http://www.incompleteideas.net/Talks/AlbertaPlan.pdf).

**Ph.D. Students:**  

Typically, we offer positions for Spring and Fall admissions each year. If you are interested in joining us, please review the [Admission Requirements](https://www.dase.hku.hk/teaching-and-learning/prospective-students/mphil-phd) and [Scholarship Information](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/postgraduate_scholarships), and reach out with the following materials:  

- Your **CV** (including a publication list, your GPA/ranking);  
- **Transcripts** of your BS/MS programs;  
- Your **representative publications**;  
- (Optional) A **cover letter** detailing your research interests and how they align with the lab's research directions.  

Exceptionally qualified students are **strongly encouraged** to apply for the [HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKUPS)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hku_presidential_phd_scholar_programme) and the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hong_kong_phd_fellowship_scheme), both open from **1st September to 1st December** each year.  

- Each HKUPS awardee will receive a package of up to around HK\$433,300 (US\$55,560) in the first year, and up to around HK\$413,300 (US\$52,990) in each of the subsequent years during the normative study period.

- Each HKPFS awardee will receive a Postgraduate Scholarship of HK\$28,100 per month, and conference and research-related travel allowance of HK\$14,000 per year for a period up to three years.

- For the 2025/26 exercise, all HKPFS holders will be awarded the HKUPS.

We also welcome students to join us through the [Joint Ph.D. Programmes](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/programmes/joint_programmes).

**Postdoc Researchers:**

We are actively recruiting postdoctoral researchers **year-round**. Postdoctoral researchers are expected to have a **strong research and publication record** and demonstrate the ability to **conduct independent research** as well as **mentor Ph.D. students**.

If you are interested, please provide the following materials:  

- Your **CV** (including a detailed publication list);  
- Your **representative publications**;  
- A **cover letter** outlining your research plan and experience with funding proposal writing;  
- (Optional) A **recommendation letter**.

Qualified candidates are **strongly encouraged** to apply for the [RGC Postdoctoral Fellowship Scheme (PDFS)](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/pdfs/). The application deadline typically falls between **September and October** each year.  

For each awardee, the supporting university provides:  
- An annual stipend of HK\$420,090 for the awardee’s basic salary; 
- A conference and research-related travel allowance of HK\$13,350 per year inclusively.  

For exceptional postdoc candidates who do not secure funding through the PDFS, our lab can provide funding support.
