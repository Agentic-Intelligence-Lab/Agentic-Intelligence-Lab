# Research Areas

Our team at the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, specializes in **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Continuous Control.**  

We are particularly interested in advancing the following research areas:  

- Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;  
- Developing a unified theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization;  
- Scaling Laws in sequential decision-making, with a special emphasis on efficient (Multi-agent) Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms;  
- Robotic Foundation Models;  
- End-to-end multi-modal learning for Humanoid Robotic Control and its industrial applications;  
- Post-training techniques for Large Language Model agents and their applications in sequential decision-making.

## How to join us

Current Openinings: (Please directly contact [Dr. Jiayu Chen](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/members/jiayu-chen.html), if interested.)

- I have **TWO fully funded PhD** positions starting at Fall 2025;
- Positions for postdoc researchers, self-financed Ph.D., part-time Ph.D., research assistants, and visiting scholars are open year round.

Ph.D. and postoc researchers are expected to be proficient at Math or Programming and be self-motivated and resilient. Applicants with background on Humanoid Robots, Large Language Models, Control Theory, Optimization Theory, or Statistical Machine Leanring are strongly preferred.
